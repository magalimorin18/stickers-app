A universal sticker platform built on blockchain to empower both users and creators.

## 📌 Problem

Users often lose their stickers when switching devices or apps, with no way to sync or organize collections across platforms.  
At the same time, creators receive no royalties or attribution — facing piracy and limited visibility for their work.

It allows users to:

- Seamlessly organize and sync stickers across all apps and devices
- Share collections without losing ownership or metadata

Meanwhile, creators can:

- Earn automatic royalties every time their stickers are shared or used
