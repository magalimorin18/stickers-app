A universal sticker platform built on blockchain to empower both users and creators.

## 📌 Problem

Users often lose their stickers when switching devices or apps, with no way to sync or organize collections across platforms.  
At the same time, creators receive no royalties or attribution — facing piracy and limited visibility for their work.

## 💡 Solution

**Sticky Marketplace** is a universal sticker app powered by **zkSync** and **Mantle blockchain**.  
It allows users to:

- Seamlessly organize and sync stickers across all apps and devices
- Share collections without losing ownership or metadata

Meanwhile, creators can:

- Protect their designs on-chain
- Earn automatic royalties every time their stickers are shared or used

💫 Sticky Marketplace is also integrated as a **Worldcoin Mini App**, allowing users to:

- Instantly log in using their **World ID**, a unique privacy-preserving identity
- Access exclusive sticker rewards and onchain perks verified via Worldcoin
- Boost trust and prevent spam or abuse using Worldcoin’s proof-of-personhood mechanism
